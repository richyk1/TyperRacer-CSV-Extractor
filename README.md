# TyperRacer-CSV-Extractor
Extracts almost identical CSV file as the one via TyperRacer using your profile name.

A small script I wrote for my linear reggresion studies, but I thought this might help someone, who doesn't have the money to donate to TypeRacer, but still wants the full report of their stats.

The script acceses public information from TyperRacer and nicely packs it in a CSV file.

**The basic command for this script is:**

```
python typerracer.py [profile_name]
```

- [x] Finish initial script
- [ ] Option to add the Text ID together with the other properties
- [ ] Make the code more user-friendly
- [ ] Add multiple exporting options e.g. txt, pdf, db...
